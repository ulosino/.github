# Security at ULOSINO

The team at ULOSINO is committed to delivering products with security and privacy in mind.

We carefully select our external products and services, like analytics, so to only include Third-Party partners who also deliver with security and privacy in mind.

At ULOSINO, we've always used modern practices across all our projects, including CI, CD, and AI, to detect vulnerabilities. We continue to investigate different approaches on how to expand our security approach.

### I've found a vulnerability...

If you have discovered a vulnerability, contact ulosino@outlook.com. Be sure to include the affected service version, replication environment, full replication procedure, and general relation to the project (e.g. 'user'). Do not report any security concerns publically.

You should receive a response within a few business days. We'll work with you to deploy a patch.

All security reports, no matter how large or small, will be warmly welcomed.
