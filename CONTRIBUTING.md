# Contribute to ULOSINO

Firstly, a big thanks to you for setting aside your time to contribute! Your contributions will be warmly welcomed.

With ULOSINO, getting an open source OS onto the global stage is very easy. To contribute, you will need a GitHub account. Read on for comprehensive details on how to contribute to both Database Content and the Source Code.

Remember that all contributions are bound by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ulosino/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This applies to ULOSINO, ULOSINO Guides, and ULOSINO Matches.

## Issues and bugs

We recommend using GitHub issues to report bugs and discuss features.

> **Tip:** Before creating an issue, be sure to search and check if it already exists. If there is already an issue, give it a like!

If you do need to create your own issue to report a bug, be sure to include the following:

- Your environment (operating system, system details)
- Steps to reproduce
- Message(s) or error(s) you get in the console, if you do. Include a screenshot or full copy of this output.

For all issues, remember to use labels and try to be as descriptive as possible (even information you might dismiss). Most of our issues are similar across all our repositories.

## Submitting an operating system

If an OS is not available on ULOSINO, you can make a contribution. Unlike other places, we don't require you wait, or learn multiple programming languages, or spend hundreds (perhaps in a foreign currency) to get something a presence on our platform.

All OSs on ULOSINO must follow the criteria below:

- It must use open-source licencing;
- It must have an upfront monetary cost, or be free (it can't use 'open-core/freemium' model);
- It must have project and community infrastructure (website, etc).

> **Note:** Projects that don't follow relevant privacy, copyright, and export legislation, or are out of line with our Contribution Code of Conduct, will be excluded from ULOSINO.

When you're writing an OS page, please note the following:

- 'Flavours' that target different market segments are considered different OSs. For example "Pin Oak Desktop" and "Pin Oak Server" would have different OS pages. However "Pin Oak GNOME" and "Pin Oak Plasma" would not;
- If applicable, enter the version of the OS that you are writing on. We review OSs and, if the description and metadata still apply, update the version;
- For operating systems which are not versioned or use a "rolling release" system, the version, and;
- To ensure consistency, we prefer you write in Commonwealth (British) English and minimise usage of styled (bold, italic, etc) text. Write within the Code of Conduct.

## Making a contribution

### Editing a single file

Often you'll want to edit a single OS page or Guide. Luckily this is easy - you don't even have to leave GitHub!

First, go into the OS file store (available at `/public/content/browse/`), or the Guides store (which is at `/public/content/guides`). Then find the file you want and open it.

When you open a file, it'll show something like this:

```
---
# Required metadata
title: "Pin Oak (Demo)"
summary: "Operating system page demo"
date: "2021-10-21"
version: ""

# Other metadata
platform: ""
descends: ""
desktop: ""
shell: ""
packagemgr: ""
startup: ""
size: ""
browser: ""
licence: "MIT"
origin: ""
website: "https://ulosino.com"
repository: "https://github.com/ulosino/ulosino"

```

We want to edit this file.

- Select the pencil button to open the edit view;
- Make your edits, and;
- Then go to the bottom of the page and select the 'Commit Changes' button. That's it.

> **Note:** For ULOSINO, empty metadata categories in the 'other' section will be hidden. View the demo page (code above) to see this in action.

> **Note for Tempo:** Quick Donation Options that are not applicable need to be left blank and commented out.

### Larger contributions

If you want to contribute to the Source Code of ULOSINO, ULOSINO Guides, or ULOSINO Matches, or make mutiple changes to Database Content, you'll need to make a repository fork so that you can work with the stack on your computer.

For information on the architecture of the ULOSINO projects, reference ULOSINO's [STACK.md](https://github.com/ulosino/ulosino/blob/main/STACK.md).

> **Tip:** If you're creating a new OS page on ULOSINO, it is recommended to duplicate `demo.mdx`. This ensures you have the latest metadata available. Reference `STACK.md` for up-to-date definitions.

Below is a recommended way to do this. There are other ways to do the same thing.

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your
   own GitHub account and then
   [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local system.
2. Open the terminal and create your new branch:
   ```
   git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start developing and watch for code changes:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Finalise by compiling a production build:

   ```
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

6. If you're making a large edit, be sure to run our tests (in a different terminal window with `npm run start` running):

   ```
   npx cypress open

   # Fallback:
   npm run cypress
   ```

7. If the build passes, you can proceed to make create a pull request for your fork!

Note these guidelines when making pull requests:

- Make your commit comment as descriptive as possible. Include as much information as you can. Explain anything that the file differentials wonâ€™t make apparent.
- Make sure the relevant labels are used. In most cases this means applying a contribution 'area' (with 'Source', 'Database Content', or 'Backend') and a 'type' (like 'Bug').
