# ULOSINO, from Hikium

Hello, or G'day, from Melbourne, Australia. These are the archives of the ULOSINO project. The team at [Hikium](https://www.hikium.com) are currently maintaining this GitHub organisation.

ULOSINO was built and launched during the COVID-19 crisis in November 2021. The name "ULOSINO" comes from "Unix-Like Operating System Information (and) News Operation", and it was a knowledge platform for open-source operating systems like distributions of Linux. Although a bodged launch stifled popularity, new features kept being added to ULOSINO until May 2022. Eventually, in May 2022, ULOSINO was discontinued, with all content removed from the service.

ULOSINO was set to have a successor. It's called [Osopcloud](https://www.osopcloud.com), and Hikium is working with the community to give it back to them. Still the spirit of ULOSINO continues - open-source is still a key part of the Hikium Project to this very day.

Without ULOSINO, Hikium probably wouldn't have happened. We're grateful for this seed, a seed which led to an ever brighter tree today!
