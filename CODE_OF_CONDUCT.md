# Code of Conduct

The team at ULOSINO ('ULOSINO', 'we') engages with the community to collectively build the ULOSINO web service ("the Project").

At ULOSINO, we believe in a respectful and professional environment, whether or not they are proposing a new feature, developing and reviewing code, or discussing with the wider community. Persons contributing to the Project ("Community Member") include a combination of professionals, employees, volunteers, and students. Everyone contributing to the project ("Community Members") is equal across everywhere the community is present (collectively; "Community Spaces". These Community Members come from all walks of life and have an assortment of roles and responsibilities when collaborating to create a better version of the Project.

Every Community Member should be respectful, inclusive, and, welcoming to other Community Members regardless of their role in the community. A civil Community Member understands that, while disagreements and conflict can occur, they are not an excuse for poor behaviour - they should instead seek a professional and responsible resolution.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

The behaviour listed is this section is illustrative and applies across all Community Spaces.

Harassment and other exclusionary behaviours are unacceptable and include, but are not limited to:

- Violent threats or language directed against another Community Member;
- Any physical violence or intimidation against another Community Member, threatened or acted on;
- Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory language;
- Distributing sexually explicit or violent material;
- Distributing (or threatening to distribute) other Community Member's personally identifying information;
- Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms, and including persistent misuse of pronouns;
- Unwelcome sexual attention and/or suggestive language, and;
- Harassment of other Community Members, and any physical violence or intimidation, threatened and/or acted on.

In addition, ULOSINO does not accept the following behaviour:

- Distributing disinformation of a political and/or historical nature;
- Excluding Community Members who do not agree with others because of a disagreement of a political and/or historical nature;
- Intending to inaccurately document the processing and collection of personally identifying information by, or on behalf of, a Community Member;
- Intending to inaccurately document infringements of relevant privacy, copyright, and export legislation by a Community Member, and;
- Refusing to make your contribution accessible, upon request by another Community Member.

Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour is not permitted.

## Inclusion & Accessibility

It is not acceptable to make assumptions based on race, gender identity, sexual orientation, sexual characteristics, or disability.

It's best to use gender-neutral terms and greetings to refer to groups of people. Making the wrong assumption about the gender identity of a Community Member can be considered offensive, and if persistent, unacceptable.

If you have made discriminatory comments, or misgendered a Community Member, it is important to remain professional and apologise.

You should make your contributions as accessible as possible. If your contribution isn't accessible to a Community Member, that Community Member reserves the right to contact you and request that you make your contribution accessible. Even if the request cannot be fulfilled, it's unacceptable to refuse a request of this kind.

## Reporting

Anyone can report infringements of this Code of Conduct by contacting ULOSINO. A report should include the information that identifies the offending Community Member (for example, username), infringing behaviour (for example, harassment), a screenshot of the infringement, and, if available, where the infringement can be located.

## Punitive Actions

ULOSINO will firstly always to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all those involved. In the ideal case, an attempt to stop and prevent the violation behavior would be made before any punitive action is decided.

However, if punitive action is warranted, ULOSINO may:

- Issue the offender a temporary ban from selected community spaces, or;
- Issue the offender a temporary ban from all community spaces.

Community Members who are issued a temporary ban reserve the right to appeal. Upon contacting ULOSINO, we'll work with the affected Community Member to reach a resolution.

In severe cases, we may issue the offender a permanent ban from all community spaces, as the first action and without notice. This action may only be lifted by our team in the presence of legal action.
